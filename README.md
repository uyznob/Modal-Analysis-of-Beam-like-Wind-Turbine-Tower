# Modal-Analysis-of-Beam-like-Wind-Turbine-Tower

The script is written in Visual Basic for Excel file. It allows the user to browse the MidasFEA output file containing the dynamics data, which should be processed by removing all text in the middle of the file. The data is then automatically rearranged in a consistent order (time by row and sensor location by column) in a new worksheet and exported to a text file for further process in MATLAB. The relevant analysis of a wind turbine tower by MidasFEA and acceleration signals could be found from the following paper.
