# Modal-Analysis-of-Beam-like-Wind-Turbine-Tower

The scripts are written in MATLAB. It allows the user to read the geometry data of a Wind Turbine Tower from an Excel file and generate the corresponding discrete model by a simple 2D Euler-Bernoulli beam element. From the lumped mass and stiffness matrix, the modal analysis can be processed. The natural frequency and mode shape are computed subsequently. The first five-mode shapes are plotted.
